      Gives to non-members of a group the possibility
      of knowing the membership of a group.
    </p>   
    <p>
      The members of the group must have the 
      {@link appia.protocols.remoteView.GossipOutExtLayer} in a
      channel.
      Also the {@link appia.protocols.remoteView.RemoteViewLayer} must
      be in a channel of the application interested in knowing the 
      membership.
    </p>
    <p>
      In order to take advantage of this functionality
      a gossip server must be running for the group.
    </p>
    <p>
     The requests are sent trough a {@link appia.protocols.remoteView.RemoteViewEvent}
